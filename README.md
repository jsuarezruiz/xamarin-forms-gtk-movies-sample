## Xamarin.Forms App 

[Xamarin.Forms](https://www.xamarin.com/forms) allows you to build native UIs for iOS, Android, Windows, macOS and **Linux** from a single, shared codebase. You can dive into mobile development with Xamarin.Forms by following our [free self-guided learning](https://university.xamarin.com/classes/track/self-guided) from Xamarin University. This project exercises the following patterns and features:

* Xamarin.Forms

  * Behaviors
  * Converters
  * Custom Controls
  * [Custom Renderers](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/custom-renderer/)
  * [Data Binding](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/xaml/xaml-basics/data_binding_basics/)
  * IoC
  * [Messaging Center](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/messaging-center/)
  * [MVVM](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/xaml/xaml-basics/data_bindings_to_mvvm/)
